# 🛒 Retail Sales Analysis Using SQL (MySQL)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to uncover meaningful business insights related to revenue, customer behavior, and transaction patterns.

Using SQL in MySQL Workbench, I explored different scenarios such as monthly revenue trends, customer demographics, product performance, and high-value transactions. The goal was to demonstrate how SQL can be used to solve real-world business problems and support data-driven decision-making.

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle.
